# Object Relational Mapping Ecommerce Back-End

## Description

The application is the back end of an ecommerce website. It uses MySql, Sequelize, Express, and Dotenv to create a function a server that will create tables in a database, fill then with products and allows the user to interact with it through URL routes using Insomnia. The application has three main routes, categories, products, and tags. Each product belongs to one category and can have multiple tags and each tag can have multiple products. The routes allow CRUD create, read, update, and delete to be preformed for each route. 

- My motivation was to use apply the skills and tools I have been learn over the past weeks. 
- I build this product because it demonstrates a practical understanding of back-end server technologies and the skill required to implement the tech to create a database connected to a server. 
- It solves the problem of managing the inventory, descriptions, pricing, ect of an Ecommerce store.
- By creating this project I learned how to use Sequelize to create tables in a database and interact with the database using API calls. I learned this be creating CRUD routes that manage the back-end of a store.
